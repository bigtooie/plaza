    <p>As an admin, you have full control over the service.
    You also get a special icon on your ID, like this: <app-uuidtag [id]="adminId" [level]="Level.Admin" [link]="false"></app-uuidtag></p>
    <p>

    <p>
      You can also view usernames of players on their profile and edit your or other peoples player / island names.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also review the <a routerLink="/help/verifier">Verifier Guide</a> and the <a routerLink="/help/moderator">Moderator Guide</a>, as they apply to you as well, except with much more freedom.

  <div class="guide-block">
    <h3>Runtime Settings</h3>

    <p>As an admin, you have access to the Runtime Settings in the <a routerLink="/settings">Control Panel.</a>
    Here are important settings about the service. Review their descriptions carefully before changing these settings.
    Settings here also include the option do disable registrations, however admins and moderators can still create accounts.

      Set the Verification
    </h4>

  <div class="guide-block">
    <p>As a verifier, your job is to verify people. You also get a special icon on your ID, like this: <app-uuidtag [id]="verifierId" [level]="Level.Verifier" [link]="false"></app-uuidtag></p>
    <p>
    You can only set verifications of users which have not been verified yet,
    or users which you verified, so if another Verifier, Moderator or Admin verifies a user, you cannot remove or change that verification.
    </p>

      When setting verification to a post number, make sure the post contains enough information to prove that the player does own the ID, e.g. they attached a picture of their character saying their ID.
      Make sure attached images aren't edited, e.g. the names of a player or the ID are tampered with.
      When in doubt, request to meet them in-game, ask them about it and verify them by trust (0).
