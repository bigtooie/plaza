  <h1>Moderator Guide</h1>

  <div class="guide-block">
    <p>As a moderator, your job is to ban/unban people, reset player passwords when needed and create accounts for players when registrations are closed.
    This means that your role is to support people in need.
    You also get a special icon on your ID, like this: <app-uuidtag [id]="modId" [level]="Level.Moderator" [link]="false"></app-uuidtag>
    </p>
    <p>
      Also make sure to review the <a routerLink="/help/verifier">Verifier Guide</a>, as it also applies to you, except that moderators can change most verifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      And don't forget that all of your actions are logged and viewable in the logs, as well as the actions of other users.

    <h3>How to Ban / Unban</h3>

    <p>
    Next to the star and block buttons next to a players ID is the button to ban a player.
    You can only ban normal players or verifiers, not other moderators or admins.

    <h3>How to Reset Passwords</h3>

    <p>
    The same way normal players reset their passwords (see <a routerLink="/help/profile">Profile Guide</a>), except you can reset passwords on other player profiles as well.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="guide-block">
    <h3>Account Creation</h3>

    <p>In case the site is under attack (e.g. account creation bot, etc.) and registrations are closed, you can still create accounts for players by using the Advanced Account Creator in the <a routerLink="/settings">Control Panel</a>.</p>
    <p>To create an account for a player, follow these steps:</p>

    <h4 class="guide-step">
      <span>1</span>
      Go to the Advanced Account Creator
    </h4>

    <p>
      Click the <i class="fa fa-cog"></i> in the navigation bar on top to go to the Control Panel which contains the Advanced Account Creator.
    </p>

    <div class="text-center">
      <div class="figure">

          The Advanced Account Creator in the Control Panel.
        </label>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4 class="guide-step">
      <span>2</span>
      Create an Account
    </h4>

    <p>Fill in the form to create an account and use a "one-time-use" password for the player to log into the account.
       Once the player logged in they can reset their own password on their own profile.
       If they forget the password or can't log in, you can always reset their password.
    </p>

    <div class="alert alert-danger progress-bar-striped">
      <i class="float-left fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
      Only create accounts for actual players, e.g. people you meet in-game.
      Never create accounts based on posts in threads.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="guide-block">
    <h3>Special Permissions</h3>

    <p>As a moderator you also have permission to modify some player profile or session properties, such as player name or island name visibility.</p>
    <p><b>You also have access to all Dodo Codes of sessions. Use this privilege carefully and only for moderation, e.g. checking if a Dodo Code is working.</b></p>
  </div>

  <div class="guide-block">
    <h3>Logs</h3>

    <p>As a moderator you also have permission to view the logs in the <a routerLink="/settings">Control Panel</a>.</p>

    <div class="text-center">
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="/assets/images/guides/moderator_logs.png">

        <label>
          The Logs.
        </label>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>You can filter by log level or search for specific logs, e.g. player or session IDs.
    <b>Use these logs wisely.</b>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

    <div class="alert alert-danger progress-bar-striped">
      <i class="float-left fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
      When setting verification to a post number, make sure the post contains enough information to prove that the player does own the ID, e.g. they attached a picture of their character saying their ID.
      Make sure attached images aren't edited, e.g. the names of a player or the ID are tampered with.
      When in doubt, request to meet them in-game, ask them about it and verify them by trust (0).
    </div>


    <h4 class="guide-step">
      <span>3</span>
      Set the Verification
    </h4>
    <p>
      To set the verification, you can either set it to <b>0</b> (the number zero) to set a verification by <i>trust</i>, i.e. there is no (public) proof to show others that this player is indeed an actual ACNH player, or set it to a post number of a post containing enough proof that the player owns the ID.
    </p>
