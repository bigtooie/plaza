  <ngb-panel title="What?">
    <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
      <p>The Animal Crossing: New Horizons video game for the Nintendo Switch features multiplayer gameplay (if you can call it that).</p>
      <p>Dodo Codes are used to connect to and play with other players.</p>
      <p>{{g.title}} allows players to share these Dodo Codes with full control over who gets access to Dodo Codes.</p>
    </ng-template>
  </ngb-panel>

  <ngb-panel title="Why?">
    <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
      <p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons was not designed to work well with larger groups or communities of players.</p>
      <p>While other services have been created to create a better multiplayer experience, we find that these services are either lacking in important features (such as accountability) or are heavily mismanaged.</p>
      <p>{{g.title}} has been created with the sole purpose of giving /acg/ a better multiplayer experience.</p>
      <p>
        The purpose of {{g.title}} is <b>not</b> to draw attention away from the threads and the service has been designed such a way as to not draw attention away from the threads, e.g. it is not easy to communicate with other players in {{g.title}}, as communication should occur in the threads or in-game.
      </p>
    </ng-template>
  </ngb-panel>

  <ngb-panel title="How does {{g.title}} help with Dodo Codes being leaked?">
    <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
        <p>On its own, it doesn't.</p>
        <p>What {{g.title}} does is it gives you full control over who gets access to your Dodo Codes.</p>
        <p>We do provide a feature to "verify" people based on evidence or trust, and give you the option to block out all non-verified players, effectively forcing players to identify themselves before they may interact with you.</p>
        <p>In addition, we provide a feature for you to <i class="fa fa-star"></i> players to help you remember players you have positive experiences with.</p>
        <p>You may also block players, preventing them from accessing your sessions.</p>
    </ng-template>
  </ngb-panel>

  <ngb-panel title="And how is this better than Friend Codes?">
    <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
      <p>
        {{g.title}} provides full control over who gets on your island, so you don't have to close the gate when you just want certain people over.
        It also allows you to attach information about your hosted session, like turnip prices or description, whereas islands opened to friends contain no information whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>It also helps to promote your island, as {{g.title}} shows a list of open islands, so people don't need to scan threads or friends for open islands.</p>
      <p>
        It's also more accessible than friend codes to newcomers, as new anons don't necessarily know anyone, so building a network of friends takes time.
        With {{g.title}}, new anons can immediately host for or join other anons.
      </p>
      <p>That being said, {{g.title}} isn't a replacement for Friend Codes and private hosts should still happen outside of {{g.title}}, just be careful who you add as friends.</p>

      <p>You may <i class="fa fa-star"></i> (star) players to help you remember players you have positive experiences with.</p>
      <p>Players you gave a <i class="fa fa-star"></i> to appear on top of the list of requesters when you host, and allows you to filter players or sessions based on whether or not you gave them a <i class="fa fa-star"></i>.
      <p><b>Only you can see which players you gave a <i class="fa fa-star"></i> to.</b></p>

        What are IDs? (e.g. <app-uuidtag [id]="uidexample" [link]="false"></app-uuidtag>)?
      </span>
    </ng-template>
    <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
      <p>IDs are (usually random) values assigned to players on account creation, or host sessions on session creation.</p>
      <p>They serve to uniquely identify players or sessions.</p>
      <p>We don't prevent the same player name / island name being used multiple times (because there can be multiple people with the same name and / or island).
         However this could also lead to impersonation which could lead you to give out your Dodo Code to a player named "tooie" that is not actually <i>the</i> tooie.
      </p>
      <p>IDs and <i class="fa fa-star"></i> exist to help combat impersonation and allow you to easily recognize players you know.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>There are two types of IDs: player IDs and session IDs.</p>
      <p>Player IDs are rounded and start with a lowercase "p", e.g.: <app-uuidtag [id]="uidexample" [link]="false"></app-uuidtag></p>
      <p>Session IDs are more square with a striped background and start with a lowercase "s", e.g.: <app-uuidtag [id]="sidexample" [link]="false"></app-uuidtag></p>
      <hr/>
      <p>IDs can also have special icons on them.</p>
      <p><app-uuidtag [id]="uidexample" [verified]="true" [link]="false"></app-uuidtag>: A Player ID with a small circled checkmark denotes a <i>verified</i> player.</p>
      <p><app-uuidtag [id]="uidexample" [level]="Level.Verifier" [link]="false"></app-uuidtag>: A Player ID with a checkmark denotes a <b>Verifier</b>, a player that can verify other players.</p>
      <p><app-uuidtag [id]="uidexample" [level]="Level.Moderator" [link]="false"></app-uuidtag>: A Player ID with a hammer denotes a <b>Moderator</b>, a player that can, among other things, ban other players.</p>
      <p><app-uuidtag [id]="uidexample" [level]="Level.Admin" [link]="false"></app-uuidtag>: A Player ID with a leaf denotes an <b>Administrator</b>, a player that can do anything.</p>
      <p><app-uuidtag [id]="sidexample" [verified]="true" [link]="false"></app-uuidtag>: A Session ID with a key denotes <i>verified-only</i> session, a session that only <i>verified</i> players may join.</p>
